AyurBalance - Ayurvedic Wellness App (React)

This is a web application designed to help users determine their Ayurvedic Prakriti (Dosha) and receive personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations.

It is built as a single-page application using React and Vite. All application logic, components, and styles are contained within the src/App.jsx file for simplicity.

Dynamic Content: Automatically generates personalized diet charts and daily schedules based on your analysis results.

Follow-ups: A log to track your progress and feelings.

Admin Panel: A dashboard that lists all user profiles created in the browser, with a "View Details" page for each.

Persistent Storage: Uses the browser's localStorage to save all data.
